# For each ansible_host name, the host device *needs* to name each of the hosts
# in the ~/.ssh/config file. Without that, ansible does not now who "backend" is

# Fixed by creating hosts folder

vagrant:
  hosts:
    backend:
      ansible_host: backend
    db:
      ansible_host: db
    frontend:
      ansible_host: frontend
